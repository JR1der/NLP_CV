job_description2 = "The High-Performance Computing Centre Stuttgart (HLRS) was founded as Germany's first federal high-performance computing (HPC) centre. It operates one of the fastest supercomputers in the world. It offers various HPC solutions and services for universities, research institutions, and industry. Furthermore, HLRS is a worldwide leader in engineering and global system sciences. Staff scientists at HLRS investigate emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing, and Quantum Computing (QC) towards realising hybrid workflows and lowering the hurdle for non-experts using HPC technologies. In this context, HLRS is significantly involved in international and national research projects across the abovementioned research areas. HammerHAI - The AI Factory for Industry and Science The HammerHAI project offers to establish an AI Factory at the High-Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS), supported by a strong consortium from Germany, to successfully meet the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure across Europe. HammerHAI will be a one-stop shop for many AI users, focusing primarily on start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and large industrial companies, as well as supporting academic institutions and the public sector. It will offer tailored services and infrastructure to accelerate AI innovation and help develop a competitive AI ecosystem in Europe. The AI Factory will be located in a region that is one of Europe-s powerhouses in manufacturing and engineering innovation, and it will be integrated into an ecosystem that promotes talent building that will be the basis of an ongoing digital transition. The AI Factory HammerHAI will provide secure, scalable, and AI-optimised supercomputing resources to meet the needs of start-ups, SMEs, industry, and research institutions. Its infrastructure will enable users to easily migrate their AI applications from laptops or cloud environments to supercomputers, providing the computing power needed to develop large-scale AI models. Hereby, the AI Factory will support the entire AI lifecycle, from data preparation to model training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining, and will provide a comprehensive package of services to ensure efficient and effective AI development and operation.
